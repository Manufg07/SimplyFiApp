# ðŸš€ Hyperledger Fabric Asset Management System with ABAC- gRPC Method

This project is a **Hyperledger Fabric-based asset management system** that enforces **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**. It enables users with different roles (`admin`, `user`, `auditor`) to securely interact with assets on the blockchain using **gRPC** for communication.  

## âœ¨ Features  
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Admins manage assets, users interact, and auditors review transactions.  
- **gRPC Communication**: Efficient, scalable, and secure client-server interactions.  
- **ABAC Security**: Attribute-based policies ensure granular access control.  
- **Hyperledger Fabric Integration**: Blockchain-backed immutable asset management.
